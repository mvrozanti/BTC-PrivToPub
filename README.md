# Proof of concept

This is a Python 3.5 demonstration of an impracticable way of bruteforcing into Bitcoin wallets. This program generates BTC wallet keypairs at random and checks their current balance.

  - In my machine, I can generate and check 3 wallets/second.

  - Supposing the universe of characters that can possibly be contained in a key: len(A-Za-z0-9) = 62

  - Supposing the universe of possible public keys we are generating being 34 characters long we get 62^34 = 8.7360969e+60

  - Supposing the amount of BTC "users" = 100.000.000 = 1e+8

If we can generate 3 wallets per second one could imagine the first wallet would be found after C/D = 8.7360969e+52 wallets.

That number of wallets could only be generated after 2.9120323e+52 seconds or, to put it more bluntly, 9.3622438e+44 years which is roughly a *Quattuordecillion* years.

# Bottomline

Pretty heckin secure money
